# Real-Time Face, Hand, and Landmark Detection
This Python script uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time detection of faces, hands, and facial landmarks using a webcam. The script leverages the power of MediaPipe's built-in solutions for face detection, face mesh, and hand tracking.

## Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Detects faces and draws bounding boxes around them.
Real-Time Face Mesh: Identifies and draws facial landmarks on detected faces.
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Detects and draws landmarks on detected hands along with connection lines.
